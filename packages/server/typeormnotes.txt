Had to put typeormconfig.json in the root directory because

Typeorm creates a connection pool when you connect
A connection pool is a cache of db connections that can be refused for future requests

This makes it so a db connection does not have to be made for each user
rather the same conenciton can be reused

if all connections are being used it adds a new one to the pool

saves resources, cuts down on the time a user must wait to 
establish db connection
